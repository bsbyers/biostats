Where I throw my R code for looking at oura ring and apple health data. Initial EDA is for looking at macro trends
I'll reupload over time, but I want to start putting what I'm working here.
The end goal is to ultimately make a report comparing the data collected between both devices to see if they corroborate each other. Both Oura ring and Apple watch have their own advantages and disadvantages and I want to exploit them.
Another end goal is to do some CDA and/or PDA to understand what factors affect sleep or performance most.
